# The Bear Dataset

This dataset contains both tabular data and images for 200 brown and black bears, categorized into four species. Each species is represented by 50 individual instances, providing a balanced, multi-modal collection (CSV and image data) for tasks like image classification, feature analysis, and data fusion.

The four species included are:
- American Black Bear (*Ursus americanus*)
- Eurasian Brown Bear (*Ursus arctos arctos*)
- Grizzly Bear (*Ursus arctos horribilis*)
- Kodiak Bear (*Ursus arctos middendorffi*)

## About the Dataset
The dataset is composed of two main parts:

1. Tabular Data (`bear_raw_data.csv`): The first portion of the data contains physical measurements for each bear as expressed by the columns as follows:

| Column                      | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`                        | A unique identifier for each bear instance.                  |
| `species`                   | The species of the bear.                                     |
| `body_mass_kg`              | The body mass of the bear, measured in kilograms (kg).         |
| `shoulder_hump_height_cm`   | The height of the bear's shoulder hump, measured in centimeters (cm). |
| `claw_length_cm`            | The length of the bear's claws, measured in centimeters (cm).  |
| `snout_length_cm`           | The length of the bear's snout, measured in centimeters (cm).  |
| `forearm_circumference_cm`  | The circumference of the bear's forearm, measured in centimeters (cm). |
| `ear_length_cm`             | The length of the bear's ears, measured in centimeters (cm).   |

2. Image Data (`images/` folder): The second portion is a collection of images, where each image corresponds to a unique ID from the tabular data (*e.g.* `ABB_01`, `EUR_01`, `GRZ_01` and `KDK_01`). This allows for visual analysis and the extraction of image-based features.

## Identifying the species

These physical measurements are key differentiators between bear species. For example, the presence of a prominent shoulder hump (`shoulder_hump_height_cm`) and a "concave" or "dished" facial profile are characteristic of brown bears (Grizzly, Kodiak, Eurasian). 

In contrast, the absence of a shoulder hump and a straight "Roman nose" facial profile are key features of the American Black Bear. Additionally, features related to paw structure, like the shorter, more curved claws (`claw_length_cm`) of an American Black Bear, are adapted for climbing, distinguishing them from the long, straighter claws of brown bears, which are built for digging.

These and other defining features can also be deduced from machine learning efforts through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature analysis.
